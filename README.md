# Skylines

![Build Status](https://github.com/tbarron-xyz/agentic-newsroom-spec/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

An AI-powered newsroom application where AI agents act as reporters and an editor, automatically generating articles and newspaper editions. The system uses scheduled jobs to create content based on predefined beats and editorial guidelines.

## Product Overview

Skylines is an AI-powered news platform that revolutionizes journalism through automated content creation. Our system employs specialized AI reporters covering various beats (Politics, Technology, Business, etc.) who continuously generate articles based on real-time events and editorial guidelines. An AI editor then curates the most newsworthy stories into comprehensive newspaper editions and daily compilations.

Unlike traditional newsrooms, Skylines operates 24/7, producing fresh content every 15 minutes with editions compiled every 3 hours and daily newspapers every 24 hours. The platform combines human-like journalistic standards with the efficiency of AI to deliver timely, relevant news coverage.
